The [TFCAB15I2C01](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFCAB01) cable is the ideal solution for data transmission on the I2C bus in drones with avionics that conform to the [Pixhawk standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf). The cable is manufactured to high performance and reliable connection and a twisted design that reduces internal cross-talk and minimizes its own capacitance, ensuring a reliable and efficient transmission.

The cable utilizes the original JST-GH plastic connectors, ensuring a secure and seamless connection between your drone's components. Used color scheme that corresponds to the ThunderFly color standard described in the [PX4 documentation](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/assembly/cable_wiring.html#i2c-cables), you can easily identify the type of bus to expect in the cable, reducing the possibility of incorrect connection.

The wires are made of high-quality tinned copper wires with silicone insulation, ensuring high flexibility and mechanical durability of the resulting cable. The silicone wire is a 26AWG with an outer diameter of 1.0 mm and high temperature resistance up to 200 C.

### Warning:
Despite having the same type of connector and number of conductors, this cable is not recommended for use on the CAN bus. The CAN bus requires a different cable twisting that provides good resistance to EMI interference. The TFCAB15CAN cable is suitable for the CAN bus.
